# EulerMethod-Tool
I developed a Python tool that uses Euler's method to solve Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The tool takes the ODE function, initial condition, time range, and step size as inputs, then approximates the solution at discrete time steps. Results are visualized using Matplotlib, making it useful for solving simple ODEs numerically.
